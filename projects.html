              <img title ="Architecture Diagram" src ="pics/architecture.png" alt=''>
              <p>Caption Crunch is a serverless application that uses image recognition and NLP to output a relevant song lyric based on an image uploaded by the user.</p>

              <p>When a user clicks the Sign Up button, the getLyrics Lambda function is triggered through API Gateway. The first function of getLyrics is to authenticate into the user's Spotify account.</p>

          <div class = 'poster'>
              <img title ="Get Top Artists" src ="pics/getArtists.png" alt=''>
              <p>Next, getLyrics retrieves a list of the user's Top 10 Spotify Artists.</p>

          <div class = 'poster'>
              <img title ="Get Top Tracks" src ="pics/getTracks.png" alt=''>
              <p>Each of these artist names is then sent in a request to MusixMatch, which is a massive online database of song lyrics with a developers API endpoint.<br><br>From MusixMatch, the function can iteratively retrieve each Track Name, of each Album, of each of the user's Top 10 Artists. Finally, each Track Name is passed through MusixMatch to retrieve a massive set of song lyrics.</p>

          <div class = 'poster'>
              <img title ="Amazon Comprehend" src ="pics/comprehend.png" alt=''>
              <p>Next, each set of lyrics is sent through Amazon Comprehend, which is used for different types of NLP. For this use case, Comprehend retrieves a set of Key Words from the song lyrics, based on frequency and figure of speech.<br>These Key Words are stored along side the full lyrics in a key:value format within the Amazon ElasticSearch Service.

              <p>When a user selects Upload on the mobile application, they can take/upload a picture which is stored in an S3 bucket.<br>This action also sends the picture to Amazon Rekognition, which returns a list of Image Tags (objects, people, text, and scenery detected in the image alongside a confidence interval.)

          <div class = 'poster'>
              <img title ="Amazon Elasticsearch Service" src ="pics/elasticsearch1.png" alt=''>
              <p>Elasticsearch is used to tie everything together. The services searches the repository of Song Lyrics/Key Words to find the closest match to the image based on its Image Tags.</p>

              <img title ="Amazon Elasticsearch Service" src ="pics/elasticsearch2.png" alt=''>
              <p>Finally, the an excerpt of the song lyrics is returned to the user interface, where it can be used as a caption on the user's social media posts.</p>

                  <p>In Step 1, an HTML response is retrieved from ballotpedia.org using the requests module. This response is then cached into “step1.html.” Next, BeautifulSoup is used to parse through the HTML and retrieve a list of tuples (the output of this step.) Each tuple contains the name of a current senator, and the name of their political party affiliation (i.e. (Bernie Sanders, Democratic).)</p>

                  <p>In Step 2, the list of tuples is parsed using Regular Expressions to create two separate lists of senator names—one for Democrats, and one for Republicans. These lists are called “dems” and “repubs” respectively.</p>

                  <p>Step 3 makes a request to the Twitter Search API for each name in the above two lists of senators. Then the JSON response is parsed to retrieve a twitter handle for each senator, which is then written to one of two text files (‘dem_handles.txt’ and ‘repub_handles.txt,’) delimited by commas.</p>

                  <p>In Step 4, each of the cached twitter handles is sent through another Twitter Search API request, to retrieve each senator’s most recent 100 tweets. These tweets are saved to the text files ‘dem_tweets.txt’ and ‘repub_tweets.txt’. The files are then split into two lists using the split() function. Each of the two lists contains all of the tweets retrieved from either the Republican or Democratic senators. The two lists are ‘all_repub_tweets’ and ‘all_dem_tweets.’</p>

                  <p>Step 5 of the program asks the user to input a keyword that they would like to search. The lists of democrat and republican tweets are then searched for the keyword, and a count frequency is recorded for each. Then the keyword, the count frequency for the democrat tweets, and the count frequency for the republican tweets are recorded in a dictionary. This dictionary is appended to a list (lod) and the loop is repeated for another keyword, until the user hits “q.”</p>

                  <p>Finally, Step 6 of the program creates a pandas data frame from the list of dictionaries (lod.) This object is then used to make a text-based plot using ggplot. The plot contains # Democrat Tweets on the X axis, and Republican Tweets on the Y axis. Each data point is represented by the text of the keyword that was searched, making the plot easy to understand and analyze.</p><br>

                  <p>Next, the main function parses through each line of the raw log file and send it to the appropriate function based on the 5 types of table created. These functions (ie. access() or transfer()) convert the raw log into a python dictionary.</p>

                  <p>From within these functions, the raw logs are passed through a series of Try/Except statements to write appropriate attributes to the dictionary. The dictionary is then returned to the main function.</p>
